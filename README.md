# Keila - An Open Source Newsletter Tool

Keila is an Open Source alternative to newsletter tools like Mailchimp or
Sendinblue.

With Keila you can easily send out newsletter campaigns and create sign-up
forms.

For smaller newsletters, you can use your own email inbox to send out campaigns.
For larger newsletter projects, AWS SES, Sendgrid, and Mailgun are supported in addition
to SMTP.
